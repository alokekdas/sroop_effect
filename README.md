Statistical hypothesis test for the Stroop Effect based on a sample dataset

In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the 
reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") 
is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed 
in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more 
prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. 
The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935.

The cognitive recognition abilities depend on how the data is presented to the subject. 
The experiment is conducted to recognize  A sample of 24 people participated in a test. 
Based on the data gathered, we conduct a hypothesis testing to conclude that if the data is 
presented in an ‘incongruent’ manner, then it takes more time to recognize than if it is presented 
in a ‘congruent’ manner.
